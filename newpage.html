        </center>
        <p>I am James, my hobby is to buy dead websites and restore them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now this website is the weirdest one i bought. this website seems that is make by some guy teenager that thinks he's "cool", and he does stuff but no one likes his stuff. but i was watching the news, and i saw this.</p>

        <p>and he said on this website that lives in this place. very weird ,but , oh well, i don't know anything to do in this weird thing, so, yeah, i just going to let this website be the same thing as before, for the sake of having something weird in my own.</p>
